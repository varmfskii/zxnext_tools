Basic template format is a series of CSV lines. Lines may be commands
or data for the preceeding command. All commands being with '!'

<none> : load 16k bank with data
       <filename>[,<bank>[,<address>[,<b0>,<b1>,<b2>,<b3>,<b4>,<b5,<b6>,<b7>]]]
       <filename> = name of data file (raw binary or .sna)
       <bank> = bank to store data in (default is next bank)
       <address> = address within bank to start at mod $4000
       rest of options are only for .sna files
       <b?> = 1 - use data from bank ?, 0 - ignore data from bank ?

!BANK : Set startup bank (V1.2)
      !BANK<bank>
      <bank> = starting bank number

!BMP : BMP file for loading screen
     !BMP[!][8[,]]<filename>[,<border>[,<bar1>[,<bar2>[,<delay1>[,<delay2>]]]]]
     ! = no palette
     8 = 8 bit palette
     <filename> = name of BMP file
     <border> = border color (0-7)
     <bar1> = loading bar (0-disable, 1-enable)
     <bar2> = color of loading bar (0-255)
     <delay1> = delay after loading each bank
     <delay2> = delay before execution (frames)
     !BMP,<color>
     <color> = Hi Res Color

!COR : minimum core version
     !COR<major>[,<minor>[,<subminor>]]
     <major> = major version number
     <minor> = minor version number
     <subminor> = subminor version number

!MMU : load 8k MMU bank with data
     !MMU<filename>[,<bank>{,<address>]]
     <filename> = name of binary file
     <bank> = 8k bank number
     <address> = address within bank mod $2000

!PCSP : Starting program counter and stack pointer
      !PCSP<PC>[,<SP>[,<bank>]]
      <PC> = execution start address
      <SP> = initial value of stack pointer
      <bank> = Entry bank

!SCR : ULA loading screen
     !SCR<filename>
     <filename> = raw ULA screen filename (6192 bytes)

!SHC : Hi-Colour loading screen
     !SHC<filename>
     <filename> = name of raw Timex hi-colour screen dump (12288 bytes)

!SHR : Hi-Res loading screen
     !SHR<filename>[,<colours>]
     <filename> = name of raw Timex hi-resolution screen dump (12288 bytes)
     <colours> = colour scheme to use (0-7)

!SLR : BMP Lo-Res loading screen
     !SLR<filename>
     <filename> = name of BMP file to use for lo-resolution loading screen

my extensions

!XSL2 : raw layer2 loading screen
     !XSL2<filename>
     <filename> = name of raw layer2 file to use for loading screen
     
!XSLR : raw Lo-Res loading screen
     !XSLR
     <filename> = name of raw lo-resolution file to use for loading screen

Notes:

Any .SNA file used should be given first as it will overwrite memory
blocks whether or not they are to be ignored. Only the last of each
loading screen option be included in .NEX. Any memory content
specified twice will result in only the last version as it will
overwrite old data.
